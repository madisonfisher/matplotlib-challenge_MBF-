Please note the mouse with duplicate data was removed before data analysis was completed. 

### Summary Statistics were found for each drug tested:
- Mean
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- SEM

### Bar charts were created for the number of measurements that were taken for each drug.

### Pie charts were created to show the gender distribution of mice.

### Quartiles and Outliers were found for the main drugs (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin)

### Boxplots were designed for the main drugs.

### Line graph was created for tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin.

### Scatter plot was created for average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen.

### The correlation and linear regression was found for the average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen.
